S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems
=============

Sometime it is nice to solve simple problems like this.

**I found it useful. Especially when you prepare yourself for interview.**

So will keep put them here, one by one as I go.

All code will be put in a `test` folder as a Scala Code with Scala Test + Scala Check tests.

To run and add news:
 - sbt
 - project algorithms
 - ~test
 - add new code along with tests in the same file, so you code will be auto-compiling as you do it
 
Feel free to use this project for your own purposes. 
Please contribute here if you want.
